They are driven by an intense desire to uncover the underlying laws and mechanisms governing the natural world, demonstrating an unwavering persistence in their investigations. Emotionally, they appear to possess a detached and logical temperament, finding satisfaction in precision, order, and the verifiable proof of hypotheses. Their values are deeply rooted in empiricism, rational inquiry, and the pursuit of universal truths, prioritizing objective knowledge and demonstrable proof. Socially, they might appear somewhat solitary and intensely focused on their work, perhaps less concerned with interpersonal dynamics than with the grand intellectual challenges before them. Their decision-making is heavily reliant on logical deduction and a meticulous examination of evidence, leading to groundbreaking insights that fundamentally reshape scientific understanding.\n",
